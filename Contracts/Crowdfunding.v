1. The contract always has sufficient balance to reimburse everyone,
unless it's successfully finished its campaign:

The "funded" flag is set only if the campaign goals were reached, then
all money goes to owner. Otherwise, the contract keeps all its money
intact.

Perhaps, we should make it stronger, adding a temporal property that
one's reimbursement doesn't change.

2. The following lemma shows that the donation record is going to be
preserved by the protocol since the moment it's been contributed, as
long, as no messages from the corresponding backer b is sent to the
contract. This guarantees that the contract doesn't "drop" the record
about someone's donations.

In conjunctions with sufficient_funds_safe (proved above) this
guarantees that, if the campaign isn't funded, there is always a
necessary amount on the balance to reimburse each backer, in the case
of failure of the campaign.
